### DATA TYPES

There are 8 primitive data types in java :-

1- Byte --> byte (numeric value)

2- Short --> short (numeric value)

3- Char --> char (can be used as for numeric value only character)

4- int --> integer (numeric value)

5- long --> Long (numeric value)

6- float --> Float(numeric value eg : 9.87f)

7- double --> Double(numeric value)

8- boolean --> Boolean ( true and false)

ranges are provided in code of all primitive data types .

## Reference  types in Java:-
1. class types − This reference type points to an object of a class.

2. array types − This reference type points to an array.

3. interface types − This reference type points to an object of a
class which implements an interface.
   
**The main difference between primitive and reference type is that primitive type always has a value, it can never be null but
reference type can be null, which denotes the absence of value.

##In Java there are four types of references differentiated on the way by which they are garbage collected.
Strong References.

Weak References.

Soft References.

Phantom References.


## NAMING CONVENTIONS IN JAVA
1: camelCase ( it can be a fields / methods / packages )
eg: bankAccountNumber

2: PascalCase ( class name)
eg:  MobileShop

## Scope of a variable

region

it is a part of an program/software where the variable is defined to be accessible .

on the basis of where it is defined :
- local to a method
- as a parameter to the method.
- class variable ( static / class owned )
- in a different class
  - local to method 
    
  - as a parameter
  
  - class variable


## Types of Fields in class ( on the basis of ownership)

1. class variable ( static / class owned )
2. instance variable ( non-static / object owned )


## Accessibility modifiers

1. Private
2. Public
3. Protected
4. Default
